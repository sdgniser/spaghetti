<h2>Rules for Golfing</h2>

<p>Spaghetti is NISER Coding Club's platform for conducting (recreational)
programming contests. Currently, Spaghetti only supports Code Golf.


<h3>Rules for Code Golf</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Solutions that have the lowest character count win (duh). In case of
    solutions with equal character counts, the one submitted earlier is
    preferred.
  </li>

  <li>
    For challenges, that require an input, it can either be taken from the
    standard input (stdin/keyboard), or can be passed as argument(s) to a
    function. Outputs can be return value to a function, or be printed to the
    console (standard output). Note that, you must provide compilation and
    execution instructions with your submission for it to be considered valid
    (see next point).
  </li>

  <li>
    Compilation/execution instructions <em>must be</em> specified for every
    submission. At the very least mention the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Compiler/interpreter version you used</li>
      <li>Relevant function(s) that need(s) to be called</li>
      <li>Method by which the program accepts input</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Almost all standard programming languages are allowed. Esolangs and
    languages made specifically for golfing are forbidden.
  </li>

  <li>
    Loopholes that are '<a href="https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1061/loopholes-that-are-forbidden-by-default">forbidden by default</a>' on <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/">Code Golf Stack Exchange</a>,
    are forbidden on Spaghetti. These include, but are not limited to:
    interpreting the challenge too literally, fetching result/code from an
    external source, and using made up languages designed specifically for the
    challenge.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Allowed Languages</h4>
The following languages are currently supported: 
<ol>
  {% for lang in langs %}
  <li>{{ lang }}</li>{% endfor %}.
</ol>
